*Cosmic ray detection with USB cameras, for the CREDO project (team project)*

### Code development

The catalog was created for codes created within the team project.

- credo_webcam.py

Code developed by Dominik and Tytus (copied from TLarcius fork).
Example algorithm for cosmic detection was extended by 
checking if enough pixels are grouped up together, doing
a basic impacts assessment (in form of deciding whether it was
perpendicular, vertical or horizontal) and some optimisation (by moving
some parts of the code around).
